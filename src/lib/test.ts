Haney’s career has been marked by determination, skill, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. His upcoming bout with Ryan Garcia on April 20, 2024, promises to be a clash of titans, and fans are eagerly awaiting this showdown.\\n\\nIn a recent episode, Haney took listeners on a tour of his opulent Las Vegas property, where he houses an impressive collection of cars valued at over 3 million dollars. Beyond the glitz and glamour, Haney delved into the heart of boxing. He candidly discussed how popularity, rather than pure skill, often dictates who earns the big paychecks in the sport.\\n\\nBut it’s Haney’s unique bond with his father that truly sets him apart. Unlike other father-son duos in boxing, their success hasn’t driven them apart; instead, it has brought them closer. Haney’s admiration for his father’s guidance and unwavering support shines through in every conversation.\\n\\nLastly, Haney shared his list of the top 5 boxers in the game today, along with his thoughts on who truly deserves a spot in the boxing Hall of Fame. His insights are a testament to his passion for the sport and his commitment to leaving a lasting legacy.\\n\\nYou can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.

From his electrifying athletic career to his impactful endeavors beyond the field, Prime Time has left an indelible mark.\\n\\nDeion Sanders, known for his flashy style and unmatched versatility, made history as a two-sport athlete. He donned both the Atlanta Braves jersey on the baseball diamond and the Atlanta Falcons helmet on the football field. His ability to excel in both sports was nothing short of remarkable. As a football player, he’s a Pro Football Hall of Famer, a two-time Super Bowl champion, and a College Football Hall of Famer. His skills extended beyond defense; he was a dynamic return man and even played wide receiver. In baseball, he showcased his prowess with the New York Yankees, Cincinnati Reds, and San Francisco Giants. During the 1992 World Series, Prime Time dazzled with a .533 batting average and five stolen bases.\\n\\nAfter retiring as a player, Sanders transitioned into the world of sports analysis and coaching. His charismatic presence graced networks like CBS and the NFL Network. Not content with just one career path, he starred in his own reality show alongside his family on the Oxygen network in 2008. Beyond the spotlight, he mentored NFL and college football stars like Devin Hester, Dez Bryant, and Noel Devine.\\n\\nNow, Deion Sanders is back with a new mission. He’s promoting his latest book, “Elevate And Dominate”, a guide to achieving greatness in all aspects of life. Tune in to this episode as we delve into the highs, the hustle, and the heart of a true legend.\\n\\nYou can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
